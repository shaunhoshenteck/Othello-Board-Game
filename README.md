  <span><strong>Othello Board Game</strong></span>
  <span>Project Dates: Oct 2019 - Dec 2020</span>
</p>    
<br>
• Used Processing, a flexible software sketchbook, to design and implement a board game called 'Reversi' with Python.<br>    
• Designed Disk, Board, Game Controller, and Player classes.<br>     
• Implemented classes that launched the initial set up of the board, determined whose turn it would be, as well as the ability to flip the color of disks if a valid move was selected.<br>
• Improved user experience by displaying which tiles were flipped, announcing the winner as well as the scores after every game, and inputting results of every game on to a leaderboard.<br>    
• Designed a simple AI opponent to make the game more challenging.
