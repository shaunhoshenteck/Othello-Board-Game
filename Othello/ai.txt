My isvalid() method was created almost exclusively to check to see what possible turns there were during a specific flag
for instance if it was black's turn, the method would check all the possiblities that black could go based on what was on the board.

This was also the case for white, and so my ai used this method a lot - Everytime it was supposed to make a move, it would select a 
random tuple from the set that was returned from isvalid() and choose that spot on the board by using the x, y from the tuple and 
inputting those x and y values into makevalidmove() method. 

I would consider the computer already hard to beat because of it's randomness, and out of 10 games, it beat me and my friends maybe
around 7 or 8 times.
